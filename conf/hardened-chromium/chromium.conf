# [1]
#	Requires patching, Cromite's solution is the most correct - https://github.com/uazo/cromite/blob/master/build/patches/Remove-window-name-on-cross-origin-navigation.patch
# [2]
#	"disable-breakpad" prevents the crash reporter from being initialized - https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:components/crash/core/app/breakpad_linux.cc;l=1235?q=%22disablebreakpad%22&ss=chromium%2Fchromium%2Fsrc
#	"disable-crash-reporter" does the same as above in different contexts, so not needed as these contexts are not included - https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:headless/lib/headless_content_main_delegate.cc;l=384?q=%22disablecrashreporter%22&ss=chromium%2Fchromium%2Fsrc https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:chromecast/app/cast_main_delegate.cc;l=179?q=%22disablecrashreporter%22&ss=chromium%2Fchromium%2Fsrc
