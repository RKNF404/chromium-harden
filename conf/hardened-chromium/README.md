# hardened chromium harden?

I know what you're wondering... what's in the canista'? I could tell ya... but then I'd have to kill ya...
\
Anyway, this segment is essentially personal stuff relating to [hardened-chromium](https://github.com/secureblue/hardened-chromium/). Some is personal configuration, some stuff is a test bed for stuff I may add here or suggest there, others is stuff I think could be added but haven't suggested.
\
For reference, this is the config files I actively use on my system (I also use the search.html and DNS policy).
\
\
The `/pages` directory is recommended, just add them where they need to go (i.e. read them, they will tell you, so does the policy).
