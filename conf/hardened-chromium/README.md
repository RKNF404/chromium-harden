Anyway, this segment is essentially personal stuff relating to [hardened-chromium](https://github.com/secureblue/hardened-chromium/). Some is personal configuration, some stuff is a test bed for stuff I may add here or suggest there.

I currently only use the policy here, plus the regular DNS policy and search.html. Use the default `chromium.conf` that comes with hardened-chromium.
