# Setup Guide (WIP)

The following guide will assist in setting up and using a Chromium based browser with the flags and policies present in this guide. It will cover 3 main sections: selecting a browser (covering forks, options for different OSes and alternatives to Chromium should they be viable), applying policies (only for Linux and Windows, but notes other OSes where applicable), and persisting flags (only covering a few OSes since not all of them support fully flag persistence). The primary focus will be on **Linux** and **Windows**, but notes for Android and MacOS will be spread throughout where it makes sense.

Please note that while I intend for this to be as comprehensive as possible, there will be gaps. For example, I do not have a Mac or a ChromeOS device so I am not capable of offering up-to-date info on methods or options for those systens.
